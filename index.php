<h1>Welcome to The Entree Gallery</h1>
  <div style="display: inline; float: left; width: 650px;">
    <p>The Martin Family started the Entree Gallery in 1977 in a modest portion of their garage on Reeder Bay Road at beautiful Priest Lake. The "entry" of the previous garage area coined the name of the gallery. "Entry" is spelled and pronounced En"tree" in honor of the multitude of trees at Priest Lake and many branches of art.</p>
    <p>The Entree Gallery recently opened a second gallery in Coolin Bay at the southern end of Priest Lake.   Affordable gifts to original art are available at both galleries. The multitude of artworks in varied styles and media create an atmosphere in the gallery that appeals to the full spectrum of art connoisseurs. Professional collectors to the weekend visitor can appreciate original and unique artwork and gifts.</p>
    <p>In the tradition of hospitality and appreciation that have become the hallmark of Priest Lake, we cordially invite you to visit both galleries and enjoy not only the extraordinary works of art, but also partake in the many different summer events hosted on the gallery grounds. Meet talented and recognized artists at the receptions and demonstrations. Feature showings are displayed monthly. Home decor specialists and art consultants provide friendliness and expertise.  Personal consultants and private showings are available by appointment.</p>
