  <h1>Terry Lee</h1>
  <p>The wild beauty of African wildlife is depicted in the paintings of artist Terry Lee.</p>
  <p>Capturing his animals in a moment of time and in all of their majestic beauty, his impressionistic style, along with his magnificent sense of color, gives new meaning to Africa's spectacular scenery and wildlife.</p>
  <p>Terry believes that traveling to Africa and seeing these animals in their native habitat helps him to see with "African Eyes". Terry feels that "I do my best to create a sense of energy and action. I capture emotional moments using color and light, sweeping brush strokes and bold swaths of color, drawing the eye into the scene. I want the viewer to feel the intense light and heat of the sun, creating atmosphere and mood".</p>
